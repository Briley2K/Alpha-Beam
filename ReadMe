Hello and welcome to Project Alpha Beam, my name is Dalton Briley and i set out to create a new type of Artificial Intelegence API. One that 
is more fluid and easier to work with, while also utilising some tricks to speed up computation. 

This Project is Built on c++ and was also designed to help new programmers understand the low level operation of AI

This project will be updated based on my free time, Im currently in college so commits wont be seen as often during the semester.
